/**
 * Problem
 * Given an array, , of real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” 
 * but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the exact 
 * same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that is printed as , and 
 * is printed as . If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g.,),
 * then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).
 *
 * Complete the code in the unlocked section of the editor below. You must rearrange
 * array's elements according to the instructions above.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= N <= 200
 * S has at most 300 digits
